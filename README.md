# Base Example App

## Framework Overview

This is an example website for the Base Framework. It is a simple, single page application that demonstrates the framework's capabilities. The website is a good starting point for creating your own website.

## Layouts

This website uses components and atoms to create layouts. Components are reusable layouts that contain the presentation and functionality. They are reusable and extensible, helping to reduce redundant code through abstract types.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Base Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisdurfee/life.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd life
```
3. Install dependencies (ensure Node.js is installed):
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server using Vite:
```bash
npm run dev
```
